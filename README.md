# Easy Forth

Along the lines of [Easy 6502](http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/), Easy
Forth is a small ebook for learning the Forth language. It includes a
JavaScript Forth interpreter inline, making it easy to try writing small Forth
programs.

I have forked this to First Make It More Visible To Me, And I am Pretty Blind.
